# Code samples
Code samples for Sandia National Labs Internship application. All samples were
made by Pranav Kartha at the University of Minnesota, either for research or
class projects.

## scope.py
This Python script was created to automate oscilloscope data collection for a
research project where an automated split-Hopkinson pressure bar was developed.

## Paper Plane
This project was for a numerical methods course where an `EqMotion.m` function
describing the equations of motion of a paper plane was provided and a Monte
Carlo simulation of the paper plane was to be written. The simulation can be
run be running `PaperPlane.m` in MATLAB.

## Raytracer
In this project for a computer graphics class, a ray tracer was written "from
scratch" using only standard C libraries. An input file called
`color_wheel.txt` is provided, containing the description of a scene to render.
The project can be built by running `make` and run by running `./raytracer1b
color_wheel.txt`. An output file named `color_wheel.ppm` will be generated,
which is a render of the scene in the Portable Pixel Map format.
